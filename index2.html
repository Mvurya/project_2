    <p>The New Kingdom was preceded by the Middle Kingdom (around 2055-1650 BC)<br>
         and Old Kingdom (around 2686-2181 BC). The Old Kingdom is famous for its pyramids,<br>
          including the Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu.<br>
           During this time, Egyptâ€™s central administration became well-developed, enabling major<br>
            advances in architecture, art, and technology.</p>
